**Overview of the Sentiment Analysis with NLP**

üß† Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves classifying text data (such as product reviews or tweets) into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

üßæ Core Components:
1. Data Handling
The dataset (likely a CSV file with text and sentiment labels) is loaded and explored.

Common fields include:

Text: The raw review or message.

Label: The sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative).

2. Text Preprocessing
Essential steps to clean and standardize the text data:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation and special characters

Removing stopwords

Tokenization

Lemmatization or stemming (if included)

3. Feature Extraction
Converts text into numerical format suitable for machine learning:

Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer.

This transforms text into a sparse matrix of features.

4. Model Training
A machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression) is trained on the processed features.

Other possible models: Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest.

5. Model Evaluation
The model is tested on a validation/test set.

Common evaluation metrics include:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

6. Prediction
The model is used to predict sentiment on new/unseen text.

Allows classification of any text input as Positive or Negative.

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details
Built using Python with libraries like:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

nltk or spacy for NLP tasks

scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

Emphasizes a hands-on, practical approach to NLP-based classification.
